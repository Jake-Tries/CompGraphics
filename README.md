CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization with OpenGL

Project Overview
This repository contains my coursework for CS-330: Computer Graphics and Visualization. The primary focus of this course was learning OpenGL to create and manipulate 3D objects, apply textures and lighting, and develop a final 3D-rendered scene.

Final Project: 3D Scene Creation
For my final project, I created a 3D scene inspired by a 2D reference image. The scene includes:

A Rubik’s Cube with a tiled texture to replicate the classic puzzle's appearance
An Ice Cream Cone with a layered swirl design to add depth and realism
A Donut using a torus shape and a dough texture, with plans for future frosting enhancements
An Egg modeled with a smooth sphere and a subtle matte finish
A Light Background and Surface to enhance depth and realism
Key Features and Techniques
3D Modeling: Used OpenGL primitives such as cubes, spheres, cones, and toruses to construct objects
Transformations: Applied scaling, rotation, and translation to accurately position objects
Textures and Materials: Mapped images onto objects for realism, including a Rubik’s Cube texture and waffle cone pattern
Lighting and Shadows: Implemented Phong lighting for realistic shading and reflections
Rendering: Configured OpenGL shaders to handle lighting, object colors, and material properties
Future Improvements
Implementing more detailed textures, such as frosting on the donut
Enhancing interactivity with dynamic lighting and object manipulation
Exploring ways to export OpenGL-rendered scenes for easier sharing, including WebGL and standalone executables


How Do I Approach Designing Software?
When designing software, I begin by identifying the key requirements and constraints of the project. For my 3D scene, I focused on replicating a reference image as accurately as possible while incorporating elements that leveraged OpenGL's capabilities. I also considered how to structure my code efficiently, ensuring that transformations, textures, and interactions were modular and reusable.

What New Design Skills Has This Project Helped Me Develop?
Working on this project enhanced my ability to design structured, interactive 3D environments. I learned how to apply textures effectively, use transformations to position objects accurately, and integrate collision-based animations. Additionally, I developed a better understanding of lighting and shading techniques that contribute to more realistic rendering.

What Design Process Did I Follow?
My design process involved planning the scene layout, breaking down complex objects into simpler shapes, and iteratively refining textures and interactions. I first implemented basic shapes, then added colors and textures, followed by fine-tuning object positions and lighting effects. I made adjustments based on how elements appeared in the final render and incorporated feedback from previous milestones.

How Could My Design Approach Be Applied in Future Work?
The structured approach I used—iterating from basic functionality to refinement—can be applied to future software projects. Whether designing user interfaces, interactive applications, or simulations, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components ensures efficiency and flexibility.

How Do I Approach Developing Programs?
I approach program development with an iterative mindset, focusing on writing modular, maintainable code. For this project, I first implemented the fundamental mechanics, such as rendering objects and handling transformations, before incorporating animations, textures, and physics interactions.

What New Development Strategies Did I Use?
I applied structured debugging techniques to refine object interactions, particularly with collision detection. I also experimented with modifying existing OpenGL functions to fit my needs. Additionally, I used parameterized functions to maintain flexibility in object positioning, reducing redundant code.

How Did Iteration Factor Into My Development?
Iteration was essential in refining object placements, ensuring proper scaling, and tweaking physics interactions. For example, I initially built the Rubik’s Cube using separate cubes but later opted for a tiled texture due to color alignment challenges. Similarly, I iterated on collision logic to create a more engaging animation effect.

How Has My Approach to Developing Code Evolved?
Throughout the milestones, I became more efficient at troubleshooting rendering issues and optimizing performance. I transitioned from a trial-and-error approach to a more systematic debugging process, making use of OpenGL error logs and structured testing. I also developed a stronger appreciation for modular programming and reusable components.

How Can Computer Science Help Me Reach My Goals?
How Do Computational Graphics and Visualizations Enhance My Educational Pathway?
Studying computational graphics has provided me with a deeper understanding of how visual simulations and rendering techniques work. These skills are beneficial for fields like game development, data visualization, and even engineering simulations, aligning with my interests in technology and problem-solving.

How Do Computational Graphics and Visualizations Enhance My Professional Pathway?
In my side business, I create digital advertisements for local businesses displayed on vending machines. The ability to generate 3D animations and interactive graphics could help me develop more engaging and eye-catching content. Additionally, my understanding of OpenGL will be useful if I ever need to work with real-time rendering or custom visual effects for digital signage and marketing applications.

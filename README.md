CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization with OpenGL

Project Overview
This repository contains my coursework for CS-330: Computer Graphics and Visualization. The primary focus of this course was learning OpenGL to create and manipulate 3D objects, apply textures and lighting, and develop a final 3D-rendered scene.

Final Project: 3D Scene Creation
For my final project, I created a 3D scene inspired by a 2D reference image. The scene includes:

A Rubik’s Cube with a tiled texture to replicate the classic puzzle's appearance
An Ice Cream Cone with a layered swirl design to add depth and realism
A Donut using a torus shape and a dough texture, with plans for future frosting enhancements
An Egg modeled with a smooth sphere and a subtle matte finish
A Light Background and Surface to enhance depth and realism
Key Features and Techniques
3D Modeling: Used OpenGL primitives such as cubes, spheres, cones, and toruses to construct objects
Transformations: Applied scaling, rotation, and translation to accurately position objects
Textures and Materials: Mapped images onto objects for realism, including a Rubik’s Cube texture and waffle cone pattern
Lighting and Shadows: Implemented Phong lighting for realistic shading and reflections
Rendering: Configured OpenGL shaders to handle lighting, object colors, and material properties
Future Improvements
Implementing more detailed textures, such as frosting on the donut
Enhancing interactivity with dynamic lighting and object manipulation
Exploring ways to export OpenGL-rendered scenes for easier sharing, including WebGL and standalone executables
